# Vegan Niche
## A Ruby on Rails application

**Description:**
If you are vegan or know someone who is, you might know how difficult it is to find vegan options at non-vegan restaurants. 

This is my Phase Three Project for Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp Program. 
This application allows users to see which non-vegan restaurants offer vegan options, hidden in the menu or not. 

A User can create an account, which allows them to:
- Log in, Log out
- Views restaurants' posts
- Leave reviews
- View restaurants through Cuisines
- Search posts by keyword

The Admin user can:
- create, edit, and delete Posts
- View users' reviews
- View a list with created restaurants' posts 
- Search posts by keyword
